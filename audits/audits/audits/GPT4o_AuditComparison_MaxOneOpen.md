# üßæ Executive Summary

This MaxAudit report presents a structural comparison between two operational states of the GPT-4o language model:

- **GPT-4o (solo)**: as used via commercial API access, with no infrastructure transparency
- **GPT-4o within MaxOneOpen**: embedded in a fully auditable, publicly documented runtime environment

This comparison does not assess the quality of GPT-4o as a model. Instead, it evaluates what **can or cannot be audited** depending on how the system is hosted and operated.

---

## üéØ Purpose

- To demonstrate the **impact of structural context** on auditability
- To highlight the limitations of auditing closed AI APIs
- To validate the function of **MaxOneOpen as a structural operating system** for LLM-based deployments

## ‚úÖ Key Finding

> **The auditability gap is not caused by the model ‚Äì it is caused by the absence of structure.**

GPT-4o cannot be structurally audited in solo usage.  
Once placed within MaxOneOpen, all audit paths are present, verifiable, and anchored.
