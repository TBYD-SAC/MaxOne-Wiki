# PAYMENT.md – ETH-Based Activation & Structural Licensing

**This document outlines the only valid procedure to activate a full system license under the TBYD Structural License v2.2.**

---

## 1. Protection Fee – Legal Nature and Purpose

Each system released under the TBYD Structural License regime requires a **one-time structural protection fee** per user key and system.

This fee **does not constitute a commercial transaction** and shall not be interpreted as a sale, subscription, service, or license fee in the conventional financial or contractual sense.

Instead, it serves as:
- a **non-revocable structural signal of responsibility**, and  
- a **publicly verifiable act of declared intent** to operate the system under the terms of the license.

This protection fee is legally framed as a **self-initiated contribution** toward structural sovereignty, governed by open verifiability rather than private contract law.  
It is **non-refundable**, **non-negotiable**, and **technically binding only upon fulfillment of cryptographic and licensing conditions** as defined in the current LICENSE.md and LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md.

## 2. Accepted Payment Method

Only **Ethereum (ETH)** is accepted.  
No other payment methods (e.g. PayPal, credit card, fiat transfers) are supported.

Payments must be made from the **individually assigned Ethereum address (user key)** issued for a specific system activation.  
This address is cryptographically bound to a single user and system instance and **cannot be reused or reassigned**.

## 3. Activation Process

1. Contact `license@take-back-your-data.com` and request access to a specific system.
2. You will receive:
   - A temporary ETH address for your transaction
   - The current protection fee for the selected system
   - The system-specific cryptographic hash for integrity verification
3. **Transfer the exact amount in ETH** from the assigned key.
4. After blockchain confirmation, you will receive:
   - Access credentials for IPFS-based download
   - System-specific usage rights according to license class
   - A digitally signed validation record (if requested)

## 4. No Receipts – No Invoices – No Contracts

TBYD does **not issue invoices or commercial receipts**.  
This is not a financial product. It is a **structural participation mechanism**.

You are not buying access. You are claiming responsibility.

---

## 5. Public Integrity

All transfers are publicly verifiable on-chain.  
All key activations are linked to immutable hash references.  
No personal data is collected or processed.  
No accounts are created. No tracking is performed.

---

## Final Notes

- You may only access and use the licensed system after verified payment  
- Each license is bound to the specific key and system declared at activation  
- Forks require transparent declaration of origin and version hash  
- Violations of the license terms will result in immediate invalidation
