# 💰 Structural License Activation – ETH Payment Process

This file explains how to activate a full TBYD system license by performing a **verifiable Ethereum transaction**.  
It is **not a commercial purchase**, but a structural entry into an auditable infrastructure.

---

## ✅ Why ETH?

- Publicly auditable on-chain (Ethereum mainnet)
- Independent of banks, vendors or accounts
- Globally traceable, decentralized and censorship-resistant
- Ensures the moment of license activation is **irreversible and provable**

---

## 🔐 How the activation works

1. **Choose your system**  
   Refer to [`LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md`](./LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md)  
   and identify the license class (A, B or C).

2. **Request your ETH destination address**  
   Contact one of the following official channels:  
   📧 [license@take-back-your-data.com](mailto:license@take-back-your-data.com)  
   🔗 [TBYD LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/take-back-your-data)

3. **Receive your user-specific ETH address**  
   You will be assigned a one-time Ethereum wallet address  
   that is linked to your system hash + license class.

4. **Send the exact protection fee** (in ETH equivalent)  
   Please do not round or bundle multiple payments.  
   The amount must match the published class fee in EUR terms  
   (e.g., €2,500 → exact ETH equivalent at time of transfer)

5. **(Optional) Add the license hash to the transaction memo**  
   Example format:  
   `Class B | Hash: 0xe13c...4a72`

6. **Verification & activation**  
   Once the payment is verified on-chain,  
   access to deployment packages, audit registries and usage rights will be granted.

## 🧭 Notes & Principles

- No personal identity is required or stored
- TBYD will **never request a wallet connection** or private key
- The payment is **not refundable** – it marks your irreversible structural entry
- This process is protected by [`LICENSE.md`](./LICENSE.md) and governed via hash-linkage in [`HASHES.md`](./HASHES.md)
