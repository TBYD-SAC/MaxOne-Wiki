## 1. üõ°Ô∏è Protection Fee ‚Äì Legal Nature and Purpose

Each system released under the TBYD Structural License regime requires a **one-time structural protection fee** per system and activation key.

This fee **does not constitute a commercial transaction** and must not be interpreted as a purchase, subscription, or traditional license fee.

Instead, it represents:

- a **non-revocable signal of declared structural responsibility**, and  
- a **publicly verifiable act of sovereign system activation**

The protection fee is legally framed as a **self-initiated, non-financial act of digital sovereignty**, governed by **technical verifiability** and **non-contractual traceability**.

It is:

- **non-refundable**,  
- **non-negotiable**,  
- **technically binding only after fulfillment of cryptographic and licensing conditions**  
  (as outlined in `LICENSE.md`, `LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md`, and `LICENSE-Addendum-A.md`)

---

## 2. üí± Accepted Payment Method

Only **Ethereum (ETH)** is accepted.

No other payment methods (credit cards, fiat, intermediaries) are permitted.  
**Each payment must originate from the designated ETH key assigned per activation.**

Each key:

- is cryptographically linked to the declared user or entity,  
- may only be used once for one license activation,  
- may not be reassigned, shared, or repurposed.

## 3. üßæ Activation Process

1. Send an email to `license@take-back-your-data.com` with your request.
2. You will receive:
   - a temporary ETH address (valid for 24h)
   - the protection fee for the selected system and license class (A‚ÄìD)
   - the corresponding system hash (SHA-256) and IPFS CID
3. **Transfer the exact fee in ETH** from your activation key.
4. Upon confirmation:
   - your key is recorded as activated (on-chain)
   - IPFS access and metadata are released to you
   - optional: you may request a digitally signed validation log

---

## 4. üîí No Receipts ‚Äì No Invoices ‚Äì No Contracts

This is not a financial product.  
TBYD does **not issue invoices or receipts**.

The structural license mechanism is:

- **voluntary**,  
- **traceable on-chain**,  
- **governed solely by publicly documented rules**.

You are not purchasing access.  
You are declaring intent ‚Äì and claiming responsibility.

|-------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------|
| A     | Infrastructure Systems             | Full system architecture             | ‚Ç¨2,500 (ETH) |
| B     | Functional Modules / Components    | Modular logic protection             | ‚Ç¨1,500 (ETH) |
| C     | Reserved (future usage)            | TBD                                  | ‚Ç¨750 (ETH)   |
| D     | Personal Sovereignty (Individuals) | Operator key + declared instance     | ‚Ç¨10 (ETH)    |

Class D is explicitly designed for **natural persons** who wish to **run an individual Max system instance** without architectural modification.  
It includes no audit obligation but enables optional structural validation and recognition.

## 6. üßÆ Optional: Audit Track (for Classes A‚ÄìD)

A voluntary **public audit program** may be provided by TBYD or partners.  
This may include:

- registration of the declared use scope  
- integration into open compliance monitoring  
- issuance of audit-grade validation logs (non-commercial, public)

Audits are free of charge or externally funded.  
No audit obligation applies unless explicitly stated in future license revisions.

---

## 7. üåê Public Integrity

- All transactions are **on-chain verifiable**
- All activations are **cryptographically bound to their declared scope**
- No personal data is stored
- No accounts are created
- No third-party tracking or analytics involved

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Conditions

- A license is only valid **after verified payment and declared system linkage**  
- Each activation is **strictly key-bound and non-transferable**  
- Any misuse, fork without attribution, or license violation triggers immediate deactivation  
- Reinstatement is not possible without full review
