# PAYMENT.md – ETH-Based Activation & Structural Licensing

**This document outlines the only valid procedure to activate a full system license under the TBYD Structural License v2.2.**

---

## 1. Protection Fee – Not a Price, Not a Purchase

Every system released under the TBYD license regime requires a one-time structural protection fee.  
This fee is not a commercial transaction. It serves as a verifiable signal of responsibility and integrity.

---

## 2. Accepted Payment Method

Only **Ethereum (ETH)** is accepted.  
No alternative methods (e.g. PayPal, credit card, fiat bank transfers) are supported.

**Payments must be made from the verified key** that will be linked to the system access.

---

## 3. Activation Process

1. **Contact** `license@take-back-your-data.com` and request access to a specific system.
2. You will receive:
   - A temporary ETH address for your transaction
   - The current protection fee per system
   - The required hash for verification
3. **Transfer the exact amount in ETH** from your declared key.
4. After blockchain confirmation, you will receive:
   - Access credentials for IPFS-based download
   - System-specific usage rights per license class
   - A signed validation statement (optional)

---

## 4. No Receipts – No Invoices – No Contracts

TBYD does **not issue invoices or commercial receipts**.  
This is not a financial product. It is a **structural participation mechanism**.

You are not buying access. You are claiming responsibility.

---

## 5. Public Integrity

All transfers are verifiable on-chain.  
All key activations are linked to immutable hash references.  
No personal data is processed. No accounts are created. No tracking.

---

## Final Notes

- You may only access and use the licensed system after verified payment  
- Forks require transparent declaration of origin and version hash  
- Violations of the license terms will void all access rights
