## üîç Purpose of This Addendum

This addendum supplements the TBYD License v2.2 and governs **preview-only access** to all published TBYD systems. It defines the rights, restrictions, and verifiability principles for:

- **Preview builds** (public read-only access to released systems)  
- **Audit archives** (structural transparency for third-party validation)

Preview access is granted under a universal read-only clause and does not authorize any form of operational, commercial, or derived use.

## üö´ Limitations

Preview-only access does **not** include or imply:

- Running, deploying, or integrating the systems in any operational context  
- Modifying, forking, or extending the documentation or logic  
- Generating commercial or regulatory products from preview builds  
- Mixing preview components with non-TBYD systems  
- Circumventing structural licensing (see [PAYMENT.md](./PAYMENT.md))

Violation of these terms invalidates the preview license and may trigger audit measures under the TBYD structural compliance layer.

---

## üìÑ Legal Scope

This Addendum is an **inseparable extension** of the TBYD License v2.2.  
It applies to **all systems**, regardless of their activation status or license class.

Where any ambiguity arises, **Addendum A restrictions override permissive interpretations** of the base license for non-activated users.
