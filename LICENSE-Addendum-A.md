## 🔍 Purpose of This Addendum

This Addendum supplements the TBYD Structural License v2.2 and governs **read-only preview access** to all published TBYD systems. It defines the rights, limitations, and integrity protections related to:

- **Preview builds** (non-operational, read-only releases)  
- **Audit archives** (used for structural review, validation, or oversight)

This Addendum also reinforces the structural boundary between public inspection and legal activation. Preview does **not** establish any operational, commercial, or derivative right.

---

## 📦 Covered Systems (Preview Scope)

All Max systems listed in [full-validation.md](./full-validation.md) are covered. The preview versions are cryptographically validated and made available under transparent, immutable conditions.

Preview access serves structural transparency and societal oversight but **does not establish usage rights**.

---

## 🚫 Limitations of Preview Access

Preview-only access explicitly excludes:

- **Any operational deployment** or execution of system components  
- **Any structural combination** of preview systems with licensed or third-party environments  
- **Any form of rule enforcement, digital identity application, or system execution**  
- **Any circumvention of licensing and protection logic as defined in `LICENSE.md` and `PAYMENT.md`**

Any such use requires license activation under a verified structural class.  
Violations may trigger **revocation of preview access** and **audit tracing** under MaxAudit.

---

## 🔒 Structural Role of Preview

Preview access is a structural courtesy, not a legal entitlement.  
It provides:

- **Transparency** for regulatory and institutional stakeholders  
- **Pre-decision review** for potential operators  
- **Baseline verification** for audit bodies or legal observers

Preview builds are always read-only, traceable, and do not embed license activation markers.

---

## 🛡️ Relation to Protection Fee

No protection fee is required for preview-only access.

However, protection begins only once a license is structurally activated.  
The **protection fee protects operators**, not viewers.  
Preview inspection **does not trigger any legal shielding** or rights.

---

## 🧾 Legal Scope

This Addendum is an **integral and non-severable component** of the TBYD License v2.2.  
It governs all non-activated interactions and overrides permissive interpretations for all read-only users.

No derivative works, reproductions, or repackaging of preview systems are permitted.
