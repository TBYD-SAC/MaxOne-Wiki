# TBYD License – Addendum A: Preview-Only Access

This document defines the limited terms under which preview-only access is granted for official TBYD systems.

## Scope & Applicability

This preview-only license applies to **all officially published TBYD systems currently listed** in the [LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md](./LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md), **including MaxTune and SDG**, unless explicitly excluded.

No use, execution, deployment, distribution, or derivation is permitted under this addendum.

The sole purpose of this license is to enable transparent **read-only review of technical documentation** and architecture structure, without the activation of any executable components or underlying code systems.

## Permitted Actions under Preview License

The following actions are allowed for any listed system:

- Read-only access to publicly available documentation
- Verification of structural principles, architecture design, and licensing model
- Public or private commentary, analysis, or critique (with proper attribution)
- Distribution of unchanged preview documents with source reference

## Prohibited Actions under Preview License

The following actions are explicitly **forbidden**:

- Running or deploying any system based on preview documentation
- Using any preview content in commercial, regulatory, or production contexts
- Integrating preview systems into larger digital infrastructures
- Creating forks or derivatives under the preview license
- Modifying and redistributing documentation without reference to TBYD

Violations of these rules void this addendum and may trigger formal audit or public notice.

## No License Activation

This addendum **does not** grant any rights to activate, use, audit, host, or distribute any system.  
To receive full rights, a valid system-specific license under the terms of [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) must be requested and confirmed.

---

## Documentation Integrity

All previewed documents must match the latest verified version as referenced in:

- [LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md](./LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md)
- [HASHES.md](./HASHES.md)

No preview rights apply to systems not listed or unverified.

## Jurisdiction & Validity

This preview license is non-exclusive, non-transferable, and structurally irreversible.  
No jurisdictional preference is claimed.  
All preview content is published in accordance with the principle of digital structural sovereignty.
