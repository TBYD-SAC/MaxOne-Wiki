| `manifest.yaml`         | Structural source of truth (hashes, versions, CIDs)  |
| `maxoneopen-v4.1.zip`   | Encapsulated system capsule                          |

## 🔐 Verification Path

Every system component listed in `manifest.yaml` is:

- SHA256-validated (via `HASHES.md`)
- CID-resolved (via IPFS mirror or gateway)
- Structurally frozen (license-bound hash logic)

> You may **verify**, **recompute**, or **reproduce** each component using any standards-compliant hashing and IPFS tooling.  
> Preview access is **read-only** – no execution, integration, or derivation is permitted without activation.
