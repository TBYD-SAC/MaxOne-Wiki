## 🔐 Verifiability & Proof Model

Each module listed in `manifest.yaml` is:
- **Hash-validated** (SHA256)
- **CID-resolved** (IPFS)
- **Structurally frozen** (form-level capsule, not plaintext)
- **Preview-classified** (non-executable)

The hash-CID pair serves as **proof of identity and boundary**.

**Manifest is the source of truth**. All files outside it are informational only.
