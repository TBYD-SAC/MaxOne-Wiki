# MaxOneOpen: Resilience Evaluation (April 2025)

**Institutional Evaluation Document**  
Prepared by: Independent Technical Assessment (Simulated for Strategic Review)  
Issued by: Take Back Your Data (TBYD) – Non-Profit Infrastructure Initiative  
Date: April 2025  
Version: 1.0  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document provides a **state-of-the-method institutional assessment** of the MaxOneOpen architecture, focusing on structural resilience, vulnerability class exclusion, regulatory alignment, and long-term system integrity.  
It is intended for independent validation, regulatory briefings, and critical infrastructure audits.

## 🧠 Summary Insight

> *MaxOneOpen is not a hardened system. It is a system without conventional attack surfaces.*  
> The evaluation confirms that most common technical vectors — including injection, session spoofing, runtime compromise, and input-based manipulation — are **structurally excluded**.

## 🧪 Scorecard: Resilience Dimensions (0–100)

| Dimension                                                  | Score | Justification |
|------------------------------------------------------------|:-----:|---------------|
| **Architectural resilience (classic attack exclusion)**    | 98    | All known runtime-layer vulnerabilities are eliminated through static, pre-defined operation logic. |
| **OWASP Top 10 applicability**                             | 100   | No vector applies (no session, input parsing, API, UI, runtime). |
| **Deterministic execution (no runtime variability)**       | 100   | System is fully non-interactive, no session state, no config mutation. |
| **Attack surface availability**                            | 97    | Externally, no API/UI/network endpoints exist. Internal logic is read-only. |
| **Data layer exposure**                                    | 95    | No persistent storage; only transient system-bound structures. |
| **Auditability (legal & technical)**                       | 94    | Full audit trail, preview license & open license addendum included. |
| **Verifiability (hash-based integrity)**                   | 96    | All components SHA-256 hashed & reproducible. |
| **Attacker complexity – technical**                        | 93    | Exploit chains structurally impossible; only theoretical vector is corrupted source toolchain. |
| **Attacker complexity – organizational**                   | 91    | No trust delegation, no external API, full local reproducibility. |
| **Privileged hardware dependence**                         | 98    | No GPU lock-in, no proprietary runtime required. |
| **Critical infrastructure readiness**                      | 95    | Air-gap-ready and fully sovereign deployable. |
| **Documentation clarity**                                  | 90    | Technically dense, but publicly available and complete. |
| **Regulatory alignment (AI Act, NIS2, ISO)**               | 92    | Architecture exceeds minimum compliance requirements structurally. |
| **Post-quantum readiness**                                 | 89    | Structural alignment complete, crypto upgrade pending. |
| **Resistance to central attack patterns (exfiltration etc)**| 97   | No state to extract. No continuity. No leak vector. |

## 🧾 Final Score

**🟩 Overall System Resilience: 96 / 100**

This score reflects a structural rather than reactive security model.  
Where most systems mitigate, MaxOneOpen removes.
