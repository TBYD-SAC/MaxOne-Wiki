# MaxOneOpen – No-Code Rule Execution Demo

This demo illustrates how MaxOneOpen executes digital processes **without any code**, using only **declarative capsules**.

## 🔍 What this demo shows

- Rule-based execution without traditional backend logic  
- Role and signature checks enforced via structure, not code  
- Real-time validation of user input against capsule constraints  
- Transparent, auditable logic – no blackboxes
