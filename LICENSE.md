## 💶 Structural Activation Fee (Protection Fee)

To activate this license, a **non-commercial, structural protection fee** must be paid via Ethereum  
to a **user-specific target address** provided by TBYD.

Activation is only deemed complete upon full ETH transfer confirmation **and** successful system hash verification.

| License Class | Description                             | Protection Fee | ETH Required | Payment Address |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| A             | Core systems (e.g., MaxOneCloud/Open)   | €2,500         | Yes          | Provided on request |
| B             | Auditing systems (e.g., MaxAudit, MaxReg) | €1,500         | Yes          | Provided on request |
| C             | Lightweight tools (e.g., MaxOps Layer)  | €750 (optional) | Case-based   | Provided on request |

> **This fee is not a commercial transaction.**  
> It is a structural entry marker that protects all parties, binds the system to the audit framework,  
> and ensures that deployment cannot be revoked, misrepresented or obscured.

## 🔐 Hash-Based Validity

This license is only valid when linked to a specific, published system hash.

- All valid hashes are listed in [`HASHES.md`](./HASHES.md)
- The license only applies to versions whose hash has not been altered or overridden
- In case of dispute, the hash acts as the **single source of truth**

Unauthorized operational use constitutes a breach of the structural protocol and may result in exclusion from future access and verification privileges.

> “No license without a hash. No protection without activation.”

---

## 🧠 Intent of this license

TBYD does not offer products, services or support.  
It offers documented, reproducible infrastructure structures.

This license is not an agreement between persons – it is a **structural protocol for sovereignty.**

It protects users against:
- external control
- narrative manipulation
- revocation attempts

and ensures that **any deployment is verifiable, unowned, and irreversible**.

---

## ⚖️ Governing Principles

This protocol operates under the principles of digital sovereignty and is not subject to any national jurisdiction.
