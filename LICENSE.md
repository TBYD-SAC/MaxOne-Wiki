# TBYD Full License – Operational Grant of Rights

This license governs the use, audit, deployment, and further distribution of all officially published TBYD systems that fall under the open structural license regime as defined and versioned below.

* * *

## Scope

This license applies to all systems explicitly listed in the current [LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md](./LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md).  
No license shall be assumed for any unlisted system, regardless of its technical origin, prior preview access, or internal distribution.  

Only systems that are:
1. officially published,
2. listed in the classification table,
3. and supported by a structural protection fee per user key  
are considered valid under this license.

* * *

## Rights Granted

Subject to the payment of the protection fee and successful verification via ETH key, the licensee is granted the following rights **per licensed system**:

- Full access to all technical documentation and compiled code
- Permission to deploy, audit, and extend the system on private or public infrastructure
- Use of the system within legal boundaries in non-restrictive jurisdictions
- Right to create forks under defined compliance and hash-verification rules
- Right to publish public benchmarks, comparisons, and compatibility reports

* * *

## License Activation & Validation

A valid license exists only if:

- The declared user key has successfully transmitted the required protection fee
- The system version matches the declared cryptographic hash as listed in [HASHES.md](./HASHES.md)
- The system is listed in [LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md](./LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md) with a valid version number
- The audit record matches the deployment version

Licensing is **modular**: each system requires its own license entry and hash confirmation.

* * *

## Restrictions

- No resale, sublicensing, or concealment of system origin
- No usage in dark web infrastructures, exploit frameworks, military operations, or authoritarian surveillance regimes
- Forks must declare origin, version, and hash lineage
- Violations result in automatic invalidation and audit disclosure

* * *

## Verification & Transparency

All verifiable components are publicly documented and hashed in [HASHES.md](./HASHES.md).  
All classification metadata is held in [LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md](./LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md).  
Audit procedures may be conducted at any time by independent third parties using publicly verifiable data.

* * *

## Jurisdiction & Irreversibility

This license follows the principle of **digital structural sovereignty**.  
No retroactive invalidation is possible.  
All granted rights remain active unless explicitly and demonstrably violated.

Disputes are to be resolved under open structural licensing frameworks.  
No exclusive jurisdiction is recognized.
