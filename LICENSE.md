   Redistribution of the systems, in whole or in part, is prohibited without prior written consent from TBYD, unless explicitly permitted by your license class.

   - Legally framed as a voluntary, verifiable act of declared responsibility

   It primarily protects:
   - the **structural integrity of the published architecture**
