## ⚖️ License Terms

1. **Usage Rights:**  
   You are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the covered systems for evaluation, implementation, and structural integration, subject to your activation status.

2. **Distribution:**  
   Redistribution of the systems, in whole or in part, is prohibited without prior written consent from TBYD, unless explicitly permitted by your license class.

3. **Modification:**  
   Modifications are permitted for internal purposes. Distribution of modified versions requires approval by TBYD and must maintain all structural integrity markers.

4. **Compliance:**  
   All participants must adhere to this license, applicable addendums, and the active system classification set out in [LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md](./LICENSE_CLASSIFICATION.md).

5. **Protection Fee and Structural Signal:**  
   Activation of any licensed system requires a one-time structural protection fee.  
   This fee is:
   - Not a purchase or contract  
   - Not a commercial exchange  
   - Legally framed as a voluntary, verifiable act of declared responsibility

   It primarily protects:
   - the **structural integrity of the published architecture**  
   - the **legal and operational exposure of the activating operator**

   Fee levels are determined by license class and publicly documented.

6. **Treaty Capsule Compatibility:**  
   Certain systems support treaty-based capsule logic (e.g. MaxTreaty, MaxReflect, MaxSense).  
   Activation of treaty rules requires structural integration and is binding upon execution.  
   The base license grants compatibility only. Activation implies legal and operational responsibility.

## 🔒 Integrity Verification

All TBYD systems include verifiable proof of origin and integrity:

- Each release includes a **SHA3-512 structural hash**  
- CID-based retrieval via **IPFS/Filebase**  
- Refer to [full-validation.md](./full-validation.md) for the integrity mapping and structural compliance proof

> 🔎 _Note on legacy systems:_  
> Systems released before July 2025 may have been validated using SHA-256.  
> These remain verifiable and are included in the `HASHES.md` for reference.  
> Starting with version 2.4, all structural validations will require SHA3-512 for full compliance.
